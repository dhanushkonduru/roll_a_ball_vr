# Roll-A-Ball VR

A Unity VR remake of the classic *Roll-A-Ball* project.  
This version adds basic VR interaction and physics to roll a ball using VR controls.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

**Roll-A-Ball VR** is a simple Unity game designed to teach core Unity concepts in VR:

- Player movement using VR controllers
- Physics-based ball rolling
- Pickup and score mechanics
- Simple environment and UI

It’s a learning project — not a final game. The goal is to demonstrate Unity VR basics and how to adapt classic tutorials to VR.

---

## 🚀 Features

✔ VR interaction (e.g., grabbing/rolling the ball)  
✔ Collectible objects with score feedback  
✔ Unity’s built-in physics system  
✔ Compatible with Unity 2021+ (tested on 2022)

## 📦 What’s in This Repo

| Folder / File | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `Assets/` | Your scenes, scripts, prefabs, and game logic |
| `ProjectSettings/` | Unity project configuration |
| `README.md` | This file |
| `.gitignore` | Ignored files for Git |
| *(Missing)* `Library/PackageCache` | Cached Unity packages (not included) |

---

## ❗ Why `PackageCache` Is Not in Git

**Good decision — and expected.**  
`PackageCache` contains **Unity Package Manager (UPM) cache files**, which are:

- Automatically generated by Unity
- Machine-specific
- Large and unnecessary in source control

**You should *never* commit this folder.** It belongs in `.gitignore`.

## 🛠 How to Open the Project Properly

Unity needs packages (UI, VR, Input System, etc.) to build the project. Because `PackageCache` wasn’t committed (correctly), you must:

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dhanushkonduru/roll_a_ball_vr.git
Open the project in Unity Hub

Choose the right Unity version (see ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt).

Unity will automatically:

Download needed packages from the Package Manager

Recreate Library/PackageCache

If packages fail to restore:

Go to Window → Package Manager

Click Restore or install missing packages

🧩 Installed Packages (Typical)
You’ll see entries like:

com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit

com.unity.xr.management

com.unity.inputsystem

com.unity.textmeshpro

Unity handles these on import. You don’t commit them.

▶️ How to Play
Open scene: Assets/Scenes/Main.unity

Ensure VR SDK configured (Oculus/OpenXR)

Press Play

Roll the ball with VR controllers to collect objects

✔ Best Practices
✅ Keep PackageCache out of Git
✅ Commit Packages/manifest.json and Packages/packages.lock.json
→ These control exact versions
✅ Use .gitignore for Library & temp folders

🧭 Troubleshooting
Project won’t load / missing packages?

Open Unity Package Manager

Reinstall any red/failed packages

Delete Library/ and reopen project — Unity will rebuild it
